# Project
A youth NGO called Hope for the Future is worried about the rise of drug abuse among teenagers. They want to launch a “Say No to Drugs” awareness campaign to educate young people and inspire them to make better life choices.  

Since they cannot afford a big social media campaign, they decided to start with a simple but powerful website that communicates their message clearly.  

They’ve reached out to your team to design and build this awareness website using only HTML + CSS.
